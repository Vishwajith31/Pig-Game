This JavaScript code implements a two-player dice game. It initializes game elements, tracks player scores, and handles dice rolling, holding scores, and switching players. Players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points, but if they roll a 1, their turn ends. Clicking "Hold" adds the current score to the active player's total, and reaching a score of 100 or more results in a win. The "New Game" button resets the game. The code utilizes event listeners and DOM manipulation to provide a simple interactive game interface, highlighting the active player and declaring a winner when appropriate.
Overall, this code creates a two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a dice and try to reach a score of 100 to win. The game provides feedback on the current scores and highlights the active player.
